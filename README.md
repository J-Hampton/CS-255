# CS-255 Portfolio Journal

DriverPass was a program disigned to help driving students learn how to drive and pass their driving test on the first try. 

I created excelent UML Activity diagrams which showcased how the software should function including loops and counters for locking out user accounts.

If I could go back and revise the documents I would revise all of my UML Diagrams to add color which would make them look better and add clearity to the document.

When considering the users needs it is important to include every feature the user wants and to comunicate any problems that may arrise or be impossible to implement to set a clear expectation for how the software will function. This prevents costly overages and prevent the development team from having to go back and reimplement software. I interperated the users needs as needing to login, have multiple user roles, display information, manage a schedule, and run payments. I implemented these inthe form of UML diagrams to clearly and visually showcase the work and data flow to the client.

I approach software design from the ground up, first defining the software needs, then the infrastructure needed to implement that design, then create a process model, then begin to design use case diagrams and activity models.
